This is a little test project to test my c++ knowledge so far.
To play this guesser you must first pick a number from 1-100 the game will then start guessing numbers, if your number is higher than the games' guess then put a capital H, if it is lower then pit a capital L.
When the game guesses correct put a capital C and it will tell you your number and how many guesses it took for the game to get it, on linux it should be within 7 and on windows it may be a bit more.
